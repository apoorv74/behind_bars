It's amazing how we keep on going from link to link while on the internet, starting from something and ending on something completely different. All thanks to Google and there PageRank, we end up with some relevant links and Voila!!

This weekend, I was going through this insightful [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3jdrw1/is_there_a_beautiful_code_collection_for_python/?utm_campaign=Data%2bElixir&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Data_Elixir_52) about  **"beautiful code collections for Python."** I kept on sailing through the post and found another blog or I should say a heaven for coding enthusiasts - The blog of Peter Norvig - He is a Director of Research at Google Inc. I must say it is an amazing blog, he takes a problem and solves it effortlessly and you end up learning a new technique/algorithm in between. A must read for all. As I was exploring more of his blog, I came across his [BIO](http://norvig.com/bio.html) section. As you scroll down the page, you will see a world map titled `Countries visited`. It basically highlights all the countries he has visited. I was excited by it and decided to make it one for myself at-least covering all the Indian states I have visited combining with the penetration inside each state on a scale of 1 to 5.

I started gathering the Indian Shape files and pulled Indian States list from Wikipedia, did some mapping and here is the result of my exploration within India.

>**How to read the Map:**

 - States visited are coloured
 - States which are still untouched are left as Whites
 - The darker the shade, the more it is travelled and explored

>**Some Insights**

 - States travelled the most - 
	 - **Madhya Pradesh**(Hometown - Jabalpur)
	 - **Karnataka** (Workplace - Bangalore), 
	 - **Rajasthan**(Mother's Native)
 - Apart from these obvious choices, I have explored major regions of **Punjab** and did a memorable trip with friends to **Kerala**, covering most of God's own country
 - States explored partially - **GOA** - Again an amazing, unforgettable trip with my friends for life, Beautiful **Uttarakhand** - Did a solo trip and have collected some stories for lifetime here, **Maharashtra** and **Tamil Nadu** - Visited to major cities only such as Mumbai, Pune and Chennai. Would definitely like to explore these states to the fullest
 - States just touched with foot and not exactly travelled - **Haryana**, **Uttar Pradesh** and **Jammu and Kashmir** - JAK is on my bucket list and will definitely visit this paradise soon.
 - Only 13 out of 36(States and UT's), this is not good. Completed 24 years of my life, one state in two years is not justifiable. 
 
 >**Some targets**

 - I have recently discovered my love for the Indian coastal region,  been reading a lot and would definitely like to cover this **8000** KM long paradise as  soon as possible. Just browse [this link](http://www.padi.com/scuba-diving/scuba-diving-travel/vacation-spotlights/india/) , fall in love with the coast and get to know the incredible Indian underwater diversity.
 - North East - This is a region still untouched, making up my mind to go to the beautiful Ziro Valley and explore the majestic seven states. Indeed a heaven's call.
 - Gujarat - Untouched, Great Rann of Kutch to be explored soon

> **Not until we are lost do we begin to understand ourselves**

It's true, Travel makes one modest and we see what a tiny place we occupy in this world. Planned or Unplanned, Travel, combine your holidays with some great volunteering opportunities at all the lovely places you visit, understand and help the ones in need. Make the next trip of yours an unforgettable one.
