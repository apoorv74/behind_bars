###**How India generates and consumes electricity - Power to the people**

There are still people in India who said that they would like to see a bulb light up a part of their home before they die. **Electricity** is a major campaign issue two months before Bihar votes. Nitish Kumar said because of the electricity state government provided, people were able to watch their televisions and were influenced by the so called Modi wave, irony. Narendra Modi is reminding Nitish Kumar about all the villages which are still not connected to the grid. Keep aside all these blame games, there are still villages throughout India where the poles are erected just for the comfort of birds.

This article graphically summarises the generation and consumption of Electricity throughout India. How states produce electricity, Sources and the per Capita consumption for each state.

>**Some Facts:** 

- The utility electricity sector in India had an installed capacity of 271.722 GW as of end March 2015.
- Renewable Power plants constituted 28% of total installed capacity and Non-Renewable Power Plants constituted the remaining 72%.
- India became the world's third largest producer of electricity in the year 2013 with 4.8% global share in electricity generation surpassing Japan and Russia.
- The per capita electricity consumption is lower compared to many countries despite cheaper electricity tariff in India.

>**Lets look at how India produces Electricity. Below graph shows the State wise percent of electricity generation**

- These are the top 15 states with Maharashtra topping the charts with ~14% generation followed by Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. 
- These states in total produce ~91% electricity for India whereas the remaining states contribute to just 9%

>**Sources of Electricity:**

Some major sources of electricity in India are 

 - Coal 
 - Diesel 
 - Nuclear 
 - Hydel 
 - Natural Gas 
 - Other Renewable Sources such as Solar, etc

Below is the interactive graph that shows how each state produces electricity.

You can just check/uncheck options given above to see the percentage of electricity produce by each source in a given state. Lots of interesting insights can be generated from this graph such as:

- 17 out of the 35 state/UT's have coal as there major electricity producing source
- Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Meghalaya produce more than 75% of electricity through Hydel.
>Interesting Fact: Tehri Hydroelectric Power station's lake in Uttarakhand. Tehri is world's 7th tallest dam. With a capacity of 2.4 GW, it is India's largest hydroelectric power generation installation.

- Arunachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu produce more than 35% of electricity from other Renewable sources such as small hydro, wind power, biomass, waste to power and solar. This is a positive sign.

Play around to find some interesting facts.

>**After Production now lets see how states consume electricity or more precisely the per capita electricity consumption across states.**

>This is an interesting graph, lets discuss:

 1. Bihar is the state with lowest per capita consumption across India
 2. Top 5 States/UT's with maximum consumption are 
	 - Dadra and Nagar Haveli
	 - Daman and Diu 
	 - Pondicherry 
	 - Goa 
	 - Punjab
 3. Among regions, North Eastern regions have the lowest value.

>Lets deep dive on what exactly is **per capita consumption** - Total electricity consumed annually plus imports and minus exports, expressed in kilowatt-hours. The discrepancy between the amount of electricity generated and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is accounted for as loss in transmission and distribution.

>**According to TOI -** 
The consumption depends on the population and industrial activity. "In Goa, the industrial activity accounts for 75% of the total power consumption," an electricity department official said. Though Goa has a total of 4.5 lakh domestic consumers out of a total of 5.5 lakh consumers, their total consumption is less than 25%. 
The power connections to industries are either in the high or low tension category. The commercial establishments, hotels, restaurants and shops also draw a sizeable quantity of power for use. 
Goa's power consumption is on the higher side as the level of poverty is on lower scale.

**McKinsey** claims that India's demand for electricity may cross 300 GW, earlier than most estimates. To explain their estimates, they point to four reasons:

 - India's manufacturing sector is likely to grow faster than in the past
 - Domestic demand will increase more rapidly as the quality of life for more Indians improve
 - About 125,000 villages are likely to get connected to India's electricity grid
 - Blackouts and load shedding artificially suppresses demand; this demand will be sought as revenue potential by power distribution companies

>The demands will continuously rise and electrification of Rural India is the priority, with good signs in Renewable Energy generation and investments in the Solar sector, lets hope that the demands meet soon and **Electricity is not a hurdle in India's economic growth**.
