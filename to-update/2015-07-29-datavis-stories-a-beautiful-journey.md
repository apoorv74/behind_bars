>***Numbers have an important story to tell. They rely on you to give them a clear and convincing voice***

As an analyst, we play with numbers, we cut, spice, merge them in order to come up with some insights. Insights can be represented in several ways, cross-tabs, charts, infographics, tables, doc, ppt, etc. Visualisation is the best way to deliver an insight and is often useful and comes to rescue when delivering results. Not only it better explains and drills down the number, it also increases the visual aspect of the presentation thereby capturing the client's interest.

There are a lot of tools today in market, both open source and paid that helps you to come up with some awesome visualisations. Programming languages such as <a href="http://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> are continuously increasing there database of libraries and packages that helps the user to create graphs howsoever complex it is. Tools such as <a href="http://www.tableau.com/" target="_blank">Tableau</a>, <a href="http://spotfire.tibco.com/" target="_blank">SpotFire</a>, <a href="https://plot.ly/" target="_blank">Plotly</a>, etc are WYSIWYG tools that are available as both paid and free versions and helps the user to create beautiful stories with ease and without the use of any code (Though, these programs also allow code insertion in order to automate certain tasks). Most of the tools work on cloud as per their subscription plans. 

Apart from all these tools, Javascript has a massive collection of libraries such as <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3(Data Driven Documents)</a> that allows you to bind arbitrary data to a Document Object Model (DOM), and then apply data-driven transformations to the document. For example, you can use D3 to generate an HTML table from an array of numbers. Or, use the same data to create an interactive SVG bar chart with smooth transitions and interaction.

Visualisation is an important field in todays market, as the data is increasing with a massive rate, most of the processes involved in the data science pipeline are getting automated. Right from data collection, cleaning, feature selection and model selection everything can be done with ease. Though in order to improve accuracy, one needs to be through with the ML literature to come with something that is robust. Visualisation on the other hand depends on the context and needs manual intervention and creativity. Websites such as <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com" target="_blank">fivethirtyeight</a> and <a href="https://www.silk.co/journalism" target="_blank">silk.io</a> are some platforms which convey ground breaking stories just by using some excellent visualisations. Google also recently came up with <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.in/2015/06/introducing-news-lab.html" target="_blank">NewsLab</a>, trying there hands in the field of data journalism.

>Considering the job market, visualisation is a hot skill to have right now. Companies are looking for full stack visualisation experts and data journalists in which the ideal candidate will have experience with:
>
 - front-end web technologies including HTML, CSS, and Javascript 
 - data visualisation libraries like Raphael, D3
 - mapping tools such as TileMill, QGIS, TopoJSON 
 - modern programming languages including Python, Ruby and Javascript web frameworks such as Rails, Django or node.js 
 - relational and document-based data stores like MySQL, Postgres or MongoDB

Its a pool full of learning guys, but you'll enjoy sailing. Now is the time to start in this beautiful field. Inspired by <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com" target="_blank">fivethirtyeight</a> and the urge to learn, I have planned to come up with a post on visualisation every week. Will try to cover the topics that are in news. If users are able to drill down to get an overall view of the story, it is an achievement.

>As of now, enjoy and explore the first post in this chain.
Inspired from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3au1sw/30_most_edited_regular_wikipedia_pages_oc/" target="_blank">this</a> reddit post by <a href="https://twitter.com/randal_olson" target="_blank">Randy Olson</a>, I came up with a visualisation that shows top 50 wikipedia pages. The data is limited to the first 100 entries per namespace and pages with fewer than 30 watchers have their count redacted; data as of 14:41, 10 April 2014 (UTC).

This is an interesting chart with **India above US**, **George Bush above George Washington** and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Barrier_Island" target="_blank">**Little barrier island**</a> at the top.You can check the source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_reports/Most-watched_pages_by_namespace" target="_blank">here</a>. 

>Post your insight in the comments and I'll publish the interesting results over my social media channels and include the users ID in the next post.
