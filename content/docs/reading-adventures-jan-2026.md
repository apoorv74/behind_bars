Recently I learnt about the [Jnanpith Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnanpith_Award). 

> The **Jnanpith Award** is the oldest and the highest Indian literary award presented annually by the [Bharatiya Jnanpith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Jnanpith "Bharatiya Jnanpith") to an author for their "outstanding contribution towards literature". Instituted in 1961, the award is bestowed only on Indian writers writing in Indian languages included in the [Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Schedule_of_the_Constitution_of_India "Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India") and English,[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnanpith_Award#cite_note-lang-2) with no posthumous conferral.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnanpith_Award#cite_note-scheme-3)

[Vinod Kumar Shukla](https://thepolisproject.com/read/vinod-kumar-shukla-resistance/) received this award in 2024. Till date, I haven't read many books in languages other than English so I wasn't aware of his work. A few days back I saw this video (with an inviting thumbnail) on my Youtube feed - [Chaar Phool Hain Aur Duniya Hai - Vinod Kumar Shukla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM6q9EJ58ps). A documentary on him and his family. I wanted to know more, not just because of his work, but also because he has some connection with the city where I have lived most of my life. As per his [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Kumar_Shukla), he studied at Jawaharlal Nehru Krishi Vishwa Vidyalaya, Jabalpur. 

On a recent trip to Delhi, I happened to be in front of [Bahrisons Booksellers](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qpXH1FuLQTARMTqx6). Found what I needed. A copy of [दीवार में एक खिड़की रहती थी](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13451113). The book was published in 1997. Vinod Kumar Shukla received the [Sahitya Akademi award](https://sahitya-akademi.gov.in/awards/akademi%20samman_suchi.jsp#HINDI) for this work in 1999. It's a simple story about everyday, with no major twists or plots. A story about human relationships with each other, with nature, with things around us. A good book to start this stint of exploring Indian literature.

> 	To read Shukla is to be reminded that the act of living is an act of bearing witness.

A brief search to figure out the next book led me to these two books translated from Malayalam - [Goat Days by Benyamin](https://www.penguin.co.in/book/goat-days-2/) and [Hangwoman by K R Meera](https://www.penguin.co.in/book/hangwoman/) . I did went into a few other rabbit holes. First was the National Award category for [Writing on Cinema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Film_Awards#Writing_on_cinema). This category includes a couple of awards - *Best book on cinema* and *Best Film critic*. Here, I came across the book titled - _From Raj to Swaraj: The Non-fiction Film in India_ by Bhagwan Das Garga, a film historian. That led to this article on [Caravan](https://caravanmagazine.in/reviews-and-essays/reeling-raj) - *Reeling in the Raj (India in early non-fiction film)*. A lot is still left to be explored in these holes. 

This [book](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/200535595-the-day-i-became-a-runner) by Sohini Chattopadhyay has come up in a few discussions  - *The Day I Became a Runner*, but a TIL moment was when I saw her name on the [list of Best Film Critics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Film_Award_for_Best_Film_Critic). She received this award in 2019. This led me to her [website](https://sohinichattopadhyay.com/), where she writes about books, films, characters, etc. This article  - [Nagarkirtan: Unusual Loves and Marginal, Gig Economy Lives](https://sohinichattopadhyay.com/2020/08/nagarkirtan-unusual-loves-and-marginal-gig-economy-lives/)  - led me to other interesting works and convinced me to subscribe to her blog.
