There are lots of ways to answer the question "what does a civic technologist do," but a decent umbrella description is: work to bridge the gap between people and government by designing and building better digital interfaces. We organize information, build user-focused digital solutions, streamline forms, and redesign websites. This will, we hope, make government services more accessible, efficient, and user-friendly.
