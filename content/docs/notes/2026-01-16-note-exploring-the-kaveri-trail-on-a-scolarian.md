<p>Participating in the <a href="https://kaveritrailmarathon.com/">Kaveri Trail Marathon</a> was my introduction to this beautiful route. Since then I've visited this place a few times. I went there last Sunday and only saw a few souls working on their farms, and a lot of birds. It was one of the most peaceful rides. </p>
