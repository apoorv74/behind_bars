This month I'm co-hosting a session with [Steffi LaZerte](https://ropensci.org/author/steffi-lazerte/) on [Using R to tell (data science) stories](https://ropensci.org/events/coworking-2024-10/).

[R](https://cran.r-project.org/) is a statistical programming language. The language has been like a multitool for me since I started using it in 2013. In this co-working session, we will discuss a few ways people have used or would like to use R to tell stories. For this session, I have prepared a timeline (using [TimelineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/)) to highlight specific instances where I used R in the last 10 years.
