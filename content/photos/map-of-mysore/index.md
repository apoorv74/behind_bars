Don't need enough reasons to work on map related projects. I was able to create these by just following the instructions in [this video](https://youtu.be/t_pOKoC7J8E?si=oA2T5KWX96OaIXr8). These visuals, even though not as detailed, often, will reveal something interesting about the space. Like for example, in the dark one, we see how Mysore has extended it's reach beyond the outer ring road. And the black spaces are the ones you'll visit (most likely) if you are in the city. [Chamundi hills](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oe6huCpRVaMKAMpD9) on the South and [Kukrahalli lake](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Y7qjL3HfruXbikpN6) closer to the center of the city. 

This [article](https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/b6HaMFgXb9Mu4gh7ZODJLM/Kukkarahalli-Lake-Mysore--A-secret-muse.html) from mint describes the beauty of Kukrahalli and it's contribution to the cultural and societal fabric of the city. I feel grateful to be able to visit this place almost everyday. The place which was frequented by many amazing writers and poets. In this book [My days](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL354356M/My_days), R.K Narayan writes

>  “Sometimes, I went back to the Kukkarahalli tank in the late afternoon, when the evening sun touched the rippling water-surface to produce uncanny lighting effects, and the western sky presented a gorgeous display of colours and cloud formations at sunset. Even today, I would assert, after having visited many parts of the world, that nowhere can you witness such masterpiece sunsets as in Mysore. I would sit on a bench on the tank and watch the sun’s performance, the gradual fading of the colours in the sky, and the emergence of the first single star at dusk.”

Having seen a few myself, I can vouch about the sunsets here. I doubt that I'll see something more beautiful.

> How many times have I seen this sight, sitting here?
> How many times have I paid obeisance to the beauty here?
> Countless times. And I’m not done yet. I’ll be back.
