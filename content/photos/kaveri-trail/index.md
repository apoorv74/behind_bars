My first introduction to this route was the [Kaveri Trail Marathon](https://kaveritrailmarathon.com/) in 2022. I reached Mysore a day before the run and had to figure the best way to reach the starting point next day around 5 AM. Had a good run on a flat route. Since then, I've visited this area few times. These are a few pictures from the most recent trip. This time on a [Scolarian](https://www.scolarian.com/mudfestclassic). The route felt same but looked different. I was sharing this space with some people working on their farms and a lot of birds. The start point of KTM is quite close to the main gate of the [Ranganathittu bird sanctuary](https://maps.google.com/?cid=16128088101496208451&entry=gps)
