**Who am I ?**
Just another creature on this planet who thinks he can read and write. 

**Why do I write ?**
Why not, till I can, you should try as well. I'm really grateful to still have this ability and though I don't intend to reach anywhere, but this just helps me talk to myself, in a bit more structured way and question myself on things I take for granted. Listeing to and sharing stories is what i love, the simple the better, and i think writing also helps me simplify, just a bit, this utterly complex system which we're a part of. 

**Why do you want to tell stories ?**
Isn't it amazing. I think this is one among some really few valuable inventions that our specie has identified and developed. It can bring communities together or take them far apart, it can start a revoloution, a human life is just surrounded by stories of every kind, who we are, what we do and who we admire, is all because of stories we have heard. Well, i think its a great skill to develop, if it can be. 

Been said that, i know most of the content i write here, is not a story but ranther a pretty disconnected random article. I think its fine and all that contributes in some form or other. This is just another place where I try documenting my thoughts, and just a piece of caution: There will be a lot of Noise!! 

**Should you read or spend time on any of this ?**
Never, if someone is forcing you to. But if you've somehow reached here organically, maybe you can find some inspiration wherever you are in life. I'm the most average human being with a lot of complications, I feel and if I can do anything, then you surely will. 

You can also have a look around this small [library](https://www.notion.so/Library-A-virtual-one-for-now-41fdd04dbfe54adea78209b316decfe3) we have here, and do let me know, if you find anything interesting in these virtual shelves. 

Thanks for your time ..
