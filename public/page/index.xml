      <description>Hi!, I&amp;rsquo;m Apoorv, I work as a Data Engineer for SocialCops in New Delhi and the blog is a place to document my work, thoughts, ideas, mistakes and in one word my journey. I hail from not-a-small-town called Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh, and when I&amp;rsquo;m at home,I love spending my evenings just wandering near one of the many banks of river Narmada. I also volunteer with Janwaar Castle, aka The Rural Change Makers, and have learnt a lot of life lessons since my association with Ulrike and the team in past two years.</description>
