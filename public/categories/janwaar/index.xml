      <description>Janwaar is a serene village located in the district of Panna in the central India state of Madhya Pradesh. Do not confuse its name with the Hindi translation of an Animal rather it is pronounced as Janw[aaaa]r. The village is also home to India’s first rural skate park which was built by Ulrike Reinhard and a team of volunteers in 2015. I won’t talk much about the village and the amazing story it is a part of, this article is about a data collection exercise which was conducted in the village with the help of some volunteers and luckily I was one of them.</description>
