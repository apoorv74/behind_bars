      <description>Hi!, I&amp;rsquo;m Apoorv, I work as a Data Engineer for SocialCops in New Delhi and the blog is a place to document my work, thoughts, ideas, mistakes and in one word my journey. I hail from not-a-small-town called Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh, and when I&amp;rsquo;m at home,I love spending my evenings just wandering near one of the many banks of river Narmada. I also volunteer with Janwaar Castle, aka The Rural Change Makers, and have learnt a lot of life lessons since my association with Ulrike and the team in past two years.</description>

      <description>Janwaar is a serene village located in the district of Panna in the central India state of Madhya Pradesh. Do not confuse its name with the Hindi translation of an Animal rather it is pronounced as Janw[aaaa]r. The village is also home to India’s first rural skate park which was built by Ulrike Reinhard and a team of volunteers in 2015. I won’t talk much about the village and the amazing story it is a part of, this article is about a data collection exercise which was conducted in the village with the help of some volunteers and luckily I was one of them.</description>
